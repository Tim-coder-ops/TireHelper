# TireHelper
 
## Concept
This application will be designed to aid individuals with aftermarket tires. When an individual puts after market tires on their vehicle that may be larger or smaller it alters the readings that their vehicle supplies. This will cause the driver to not know their true milage, speed or MPG unless they do the calculations on their own. I seek to make that proccess easier with this application. It will allow the user to input their stock tire size and will then allow then to check what their true MPG, milage, and road speeds are.
